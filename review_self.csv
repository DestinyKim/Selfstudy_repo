betsym23,"April 6, 2021",5,"Tried a different brand that had no popping noise so returned them. These ones are thicker and actually have a popping sound that my kids, ages 1, 3 and 5, love! Bought the rainbow ones, and the colors are vibrant and pretty too. Kids love them!"
Domingos,"January 11, 2021",5,My daughter absolutely loves this PoP IT set. Great quality and the purple üíú has the alphabet letters on it.
Miranda L,"May 20, 2021",5,"These have definitely exceeded my expectations! I work with students in special education, specifically students with visual impairments, and I appreciate the tactile details on these fidgets. I haven‚Äôt tried them out yet, but I will report back if there are any unforeseen issues. Super duper cute (and bigger than expected!)!"
M.W.,"January 13, 2021",5,My daughter really loves fidget toys and this one doesn't disappoint.  She uses these to keep her hands occupied so she doesn't bite her nails.  This items comes with four different pop-it's in different shapes and they all have different levels of sounds depending on the side you are playing with. Nice product for the price.
LaVonda Bradshaw,"January 11, 2021",5,This was on my daughter‚Äôs Christmas list. They appeared sturdy. It‚Äôs only been a few weeks and they are holding up great. She plays with them all the time.
jbeygirls,"April 25, 2021",5,"I bought these for my kids but I like them just as much. Have one sitting next to me at my desk. When I need a break just mess around with this for a few seconds and you relax. Kids love them too, toddlers and the teens."
Lesa Browning,"May 21, 2021",5,"Looked at so many of these things, they seem to be everywhere. These are a good size, they look almost like a small pot holder in size. LOL. My daughter loves that she got a pack of four and they are vibrant."
Nikki,"February 11, 2021",3,We were so excited to receive these today and right out of the package the purple one has a hole in one of the bubbles! Of course that is the one with the alphabet that my little one wanted! I hope this isn‚Äôt a sign of the durability of this product.
Elliott de Luca,"March 17, 2021",2,"Although they look and feel wonderful, this item doesn't come near the promised experience. Tested them upon arrival to our home yesterday with our bubble-crazed children and they haven't picked them up since. Thumbs down from the whole house. Sigh. Too bad."
mYum,"April 19, 2021",5,"There are so many ways my kids are enjoying this toy. We play a reverse-tic-tac-toe on the orange pop it (the two players take turns popping one at a time, and the first to pop a complete row horizontally/vertically/diagonally loses), the heart shaped one has the alphabet on the bumps, so it‚Äôs nice for writing messages or keeping track while playing hangman. Our toddler just likes the feel of popping and it‚Äôll be useful in learning colors and counting."
Darian Bourgeois,"April 7, 2021",3,"You definitely get your value for money with this product. They were cute and well made. However, the bubbles were entirely too thin and flimsy to get the sensory satisfaction of ‚Äúpopping‚Äù them in and out. If they were made a little thicker this would be perfect."
Burke mom,"April 5, 2021",5,"I bought these for my grandkids for Easter.  They couldn't put them down.  Out of their giant baskets, this was what they love a the most.  My daughter is going to buy several sets for her middle school classroom.  Highly recommend."
Roxana,"April 25, 2021",5,"My 9yr old daughter wanted a poppet/fidget toys when she saw them on tik tok. I‚Äôm so glad I found these. They‚Äôre really cute, good size and Worth the money. My 9yr old Is very fidgety üò¨ and my 16 yr old has really bad anxiety and I‚Äôve notice when they‚Äôre playing with them, they‚Äôre very calm and relaxed.A big plus, easy to clean and disinfect!"
Elaine,"January 13, 2021",5,My autistic grandson loves these. So does my granddaughter that is 6 years old. They‚Äôre like never ending bubble wrap!
Asaskow,"February 20, 2021",5,My two daughters love these.  They keep them busy and still.  I liked the assortment it came with as well as the colors.  Quality is great as well and indestructible.
Abbie Perez,"April 2, 2021",4,"love the shapes, colors. they‚Äôre not ‚Äústurdy‚Äù i think because the surface area is so large it makes them wobbly and a little difficult for my toddler to pop the bubbles (small hands). but i mean he loves them and they work and i‚Äôm satisfied with them. i‚Äôm putting  them into easter baskets."
Joy c.,"March 15, 2021",1,Seriously unimpressed. The yellow/ purple  one doesn‚Äôt even make a pop sound. I got the 4 pack one for each of my kids and my 6yr was so sad the yellow and purple makes no pop sound at ALL. The orange had the best pop.
Sheryl,"April 16, 2021",5,Bought these for my grandkids and they love them! They love the different shapes and colors! They play with them all the time!
Crystal Collins,"March 28, 2021",5,My daughter is on the spectrum and she loves them and we all enjoy them as a family too. It's somewhat of a stress reliever as well.
LL,"April 26, 2021",4,"I bought 4 of these to give 1 to my daughter, 2 to her son and one for myself.  We all love popping the small bubble wrap bubbles...feeling that slight pressure and then hearing the snap/pop.  It's great.  However, these items might work for most but we feel they do not satisfy us much at all. Although they do have more function or purpose than the  bubble wrap.. like have the alphabet letters on them and you can play some games with them."
Autism mom,"February 22, 2021",5,"These are colorful, make the popping sound! Not as loud as the ‚Äúname brand‚Äù but I am not complaining!!! Very cute shapes too!!"
Krimmy,"March 30, 2021",5,Purchased these for my grandchildren. Arrived as pictured only thing I thought they would have more of a popping sound.
Jocelyn Villalobos,"March 15, 2021",5,"Very durable and washable. My son has autism and this is a great sensory toy for him and he's not gentle with toys. Very durable!! Also one of the shapes has the alphabet, works great at getting him to practice his abc‚Äôs. Definitely recommended."
Mrs Martin,"April 15, 2021",5,This is my third purchase. Daughter and both nieces live this thing!!
Danielle Holmes,"April 3, 2021",5,"I absolutely love these! I love the popping noise they make when you press them down. The product is super thick and durable, making it worth the money. I love that I can just put them in soapy water if they need cleaned or disinfected. I think I play with them more than my child does!"
abbie g.,"March 18, 2021",5,Just bought for my kids because they're obsessed with tik tok. They were so happy
Brianna White,"April 10, 2021",3,I think these are pretty good I think all these toys are overpriced for sure.
Karen Weber,"April 7, 2021",3,They didn‚Äôt pop. I thought it was a waste of money.
Desiree Mullikin ,"April 24, 2021",5,Keeping kids settled for church and car rides can be a chore. These keep my four kids from pestering each other constantly.
Susan D.,"May 31, 2021",5,This product stands up very well! My 20 month old granddaughter put it to the test! Kept her hands busy for a long time! (And her mouth!)Love the colors and shapes!
Deb's Foodie Family Fun,"April 3, 2021",3,Only 2 if the 4 pieces were received. The orange square and purple heart were the only ones received. It looks like someone already opened it and possibly removed it from the plastic wrapping.
Marlene Tiesling,"February 9, 2021",4,The kids like them but one came damaged as seen in the photo.
jtg,"May 19, 2021",5,"Purchased for my 9 year old daughter. She loved them. However, like most things, she barely uses them after a few days."
Jewels,"May 18, 2021",5,"Awesome, colorful, fun shaped little Pop It‚Äôs!  Put in my kids Easter baskets and they love them.  Just as good as the best ones out there!"
Amy,"January 24, 2021",5,Enjoying these
Jacie Borchard,"April 8, 2021",5,Lovvvve these! My students grab these all the time to play with! Plus they texture in the poppers are a great sensory input too!
OnFrostedFields,"May 26, 2021",2,"One out of four arrived with two holes, and with more fragile bubbles, as if not enough material had been poured into the mold in manufacturing."
Nova,"March 22, 2021",3,I was disappointed that only one out of the four actually did the little popping sounds which was the main reason I got them
Randy,"March 30, 2021",5,"I ordered this item online for my daughter, and I thought that it was tiny. It came in a big box, and behold they were gigantinc pop its. She loved playing with them, the items are a great price."
p. stav,"February 22, 2021",5,Bought them for my 9 year old. Didn't expect my 2 year old to play with it quietly for 2 HOURS!! Lol...its everlasting bubble wrap
Me,"May 31, 2021",4,Fun little figit toy. Eyes broke quickly on octopus- eyes don‚Äôt pop like other. All others are great!
gam,"April 14, 2021",5,These are awesome. Kids love playing with them.
theresa burford,"May 4, 2021",5,Definitely not cheap! My 3 kids love them. Cute little games and anxiety relief.
Amazon Customer,"March 16, 2021",5,For anyone who loves to pop bubble wrap... got for each of my grandkids keeps them busy and quiet!
Alan Reisdorph,"May 30, 2021",5,This 3 piece set is a great value since at Rhine one piece cost as much as this set. Easy to keep clean. Months later and still functions as day we got them. Recommend buy and would purchase again
Johnny Quatro,"March 16, 2021",5,"Kids loved them, so did the adults. They kiddos even brought them to bed and did not fuss like normal.Also going to put them in the car to keep the kids occupied when having to wait vs. ipads."
NICOLE,"February 24, 2021",5,Purchased for Valentines gifts for my kids.  They have been using them regularly and they are holding up well. Hours of fun and well made nice and thick and durable.
Jaxs,"June 10, 2021",5,"Got these for my kiddos my little one is on the Spectrum. Whenever he needs sensory or is having a meltdown, I just hand him one of these bad boys and he's ready to go. Great buy!"
Janina J. Suto,"March 18, 2021",3,"Didn't meet my expectations of hearing the ""pop"" you get when popping bubble wrap.  Very little sound and only on the reverse side."
Danielle,"March 4, 2021",5,This is an excellent product for children and adults. Games can be made from it to keep them occupied.
